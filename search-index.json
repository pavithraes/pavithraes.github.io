[{"content":"\rI\u0026rsquo;ve been bullet journaling for almost 2 years. This feels amazing to say because no other planning/organising system has worked for me for more than few weeks me. So, in this quick post, I want to share why I love bullet journaling and what my personal setup looks like.\nWait a minute, what is bullet journaling? In a nutshell, it is using a plain old paper notebook as your planner with one main rule: maintain an index. Everything else is up to you. Most people have a regular \u0026ldquo;spread\u0026rdquo;, or template, for the year/month/week/day plans, notes, habit trackers, etc. with a task management system that works for them like checklists, kanban boards, etc. Lots of people also enjoy decorating and personalising their journals.\nHere one I found on Unsplash: Search for \u0026ldquo;bullet journal\u0026rdquo; on Pinterest and you\u0026rsquo;ll find a variety of absolutely beautiful and creative designs. The opportunities are endless. 💫\nMy setup My bullet journaling setup is on the minimal-er side. I decorate and use colours sometimes, but mostly I keep it simple. This reduces the threshold to actually using the journal. I have a regular monthly and weekly spread, I\u0026rsquo;ve shared pictures of their baisc structure below.\nMonthly spread This page doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much of a function purpose. I like creating this because it serves as a natural checkpoint — not only in the journal, but also just in general. It gives me a chance to reflect and think about things I\u0026rsquo;d like to change in the coming month.\nAs you can see, I just have a calendar setup for September. September is a calm month for me because I took a break before starting a new role. I might write a theme on the side or add some stickers later.\nWeekly spread This is the important spread.\nI landed on this spread after many iterations, and it\u0026rsquo;ll continue to change. \u0026ldquo;Daily\u0026rdquo; views were a little too granular for me, so I decided to not do it and have just a weekly view. It\u0026rsquo;s also nice to have the whole week in mind while prioritising and scheduling.\nI limit myself to 5 top priorities for the week and 3 top priorities for each day. If these get done, I can call my week/day a success. I use different symbols to differentiate these \u0026ldquo;priority\u0026rdquo; tasks and from other tasks.\nI also keep track of meetings here. Meetings take up a significant amount of time, so it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have these commitments in view while planning the tasks for the day. For example, on meeting heavy days, I might have comparatively smaller \u0026ldquo;priorities\u0026rdquo;.\nOther things I use my journal for Basically anything I want to write down. Shopping lists, habit tracking, thoughts and feelings, goals and planning, work meeting preparation, meeting notes and action items, rough blog post drafts, etc. Because I have an index to know what is where, things don\u0026rsquo;t get lost in the void.\nWhy a bullet journal works for me (I think) I love the flexibility and personalisation bullet journaling offers. In my opinion, there is no \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; way to do it. It can also evolve and grow with me, and accommodate everything I need it to.\nBullet journaling forces me to physically re-write a task to move it to a future date. Which means I don\u0026rsquo;t forget it, and there is a non-trivial amount of effort involved in moving the task. If I have moved a task ~3 times, it might mean I there is some mental/physical blocker to completing it. I can re-evaluate its priority and complexity each time I write it. I can also consider breaking it down or narrowing the scope.\nAs of today, I actually write faster than I type, so I\u0026rsquo;m more comfortable with pen and paper. It\u0026rsquo;s also fun to use colors, stickers, and decorative tape to capture how I\u0026rsquo;m feeling sometimes. 🎨\nHowever… I have my journal open on my table all the time. It\u0026rsquo;s always in view and within reach. I can do this because I\u0026rsquo;ve been working remotely for the past couple of years. Maybe bullet journaling has worked for me for this very reason. Maybe it won\u0026rsquo;t work for me when I need to travel or go into a physical office. Maybe.\nHowever, bullet journaling has now also become a strong habit and a very important part of my day. It bring me a lot of joy and clarity. So honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful that it\u0026rsquo;ll continue to work even outside of remote environments. :)\nAll of that said, it\u0026rsquo;s obviously not a perfect system and I don\u0026rsquo;t use it perfectly all the time. I\u0026rsquo;m human, so I do tend to forget things, I feel lazy sometimes, and I have rough days. Even with the super low threshold to maintain my journal, on some days I just can\u0026rsquo;t, so I don\u0026rsquo;t. My \u0026ldquo;week-view\u0026rdquo; sometimes has one or more blank days. The goal here isn\u0026rsquo;t to do everything perfectly, the goal is to keep at it. It is okay if I miss a couple of days. I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to go back the day after and continue where I left off. 🌻\nThanks for reading! What is your planning system like? Have you used a bullet journal before? Do you have tips on how I can improve my setup? Let me know on Twitter!\nAttributions:\nHeader Image: Photo by Jess Bailey on Unsplash ","date":"2022-09-17","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/bullet-journaling-my-setup/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been bullet journaling for almost 2 years.

Hence, effective communication is important for any project to function smoothly.\nEspecially, asynchronous-written communication.\nI started contributing to FOSS over a year ago. Communication was one of the first things I had to learn. I\u0026rsquo;m still working on it, but I think I\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way. Here are some key points I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up.\nBefore we get to the details, I want to preface this post by saying that asking questions and sharing your thoughts is more important than following any guidelines. You can improve your communication as you go, but never hesitate to speak up because you think it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;well-phrased\u0026rdquo;. People are nice. People will correct you if you make mistakes. So, the first step is to get involved in the discussion, you can then focus on improving. :)\nPlatform matters There are various \u0026ldquo;spaces\u0026rdquo; where people talk — mailing lists, discussion forums, private chat, issue trackers, etc. Each space has it\u0026rsquo;s own guidelines. It\u0026rsquo;s useful to know these while posting messages.\nMailing lists - Formal, email-like wording is generally preferred. You can start with a greeting and end with salutation+signature. You are expected to add a relevant subject line. Some people prefer to have a word wrap, it improves readability.\nDiscussion forum - Generally, there is no need for a formal greeting, salutation and signature. It is more informal than an email. Discussion forums typically include IRC, Discourse, Discord, Slack, Zulip, Gitter, Hangouts, and Telegram. Make sure that you understand a little about the platform and the primary reason why the organization uses it. For example, at Bokeh, Slack is used for development discussions and Discourse for community support. Also, note that some platforms like IRC have additional steps like registering your nickname.\nPrivate message - You can generally be as informal as in a discussion forum. There are no strict guidelines here, just be nice.\nMind your language Always, always, always use inclusive language. I wrote more about this in a previous post. Assume positive intent - Most people are nice and want the best for the project. Sometimes, their words may come across as rude or hurtful. Start with a foundation of positive intent: no-one wants to hurt you. This will allow you to not take criticism personally, and avoid any unnecessary arguments. That said, some behaviour is unacceptable. If any comments violate the project\u0026rsquo;s CoC, please take necessary action. Read the room - Try to be mindful of the emotions in the room. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this in 2020 when the world is having a rough year. Having compassion in your words and checking up on people are small acts of kindness that can go a long way. Be open to suggestions - Everyone has some value to add to the discussion. Be mindful about giving people a chance to express their thoughts and try to understand their point of view. Asking questions effectively Research and be specific - Take a few minutes to Google your question and go through the project documentation before asking questions. Most of the time, you will find the answer without needing to ask someone. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find the answer after say 10-20 mins of searching yourself, go ahead and post the question. Make sure to mention where you searched and what you found. Sometimes, things get buried in the documentation. Asking questions can surface them and the documentation can be improved. Include all relevant information - If you are facing a software issue, include relevant information like your operating system, environment, software version, browser info, etc. along with a minimal+reproducible example. This helps the developers diagnose the issue accurately, and saves everyone some time. Be bold - No question is a dumb question. Really! For example, instead of \u0026ldquo;How do I get started with\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, try:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going through the getting started documentation and I\u0026rsquo;m stuck at this step. Here is my system information and a reproducible example. I\u0026rsquo;ve also included a screenshot of the issue at the end.\u0026rdquo;\nPlease be patient FOSS contributors and maintainers are volunteers. After posting a question, be patient for folks to answer. It might take them up to 2-3 days to get back to you. If there is a holiday in their country or if it\u0026rsquo;s a weekend, it might take even longer. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get a reply after ~3 working days, you can follow up politely.\nAccent is a speed breaker This is a fairly recent realization. I have some trouble interacting with people who have a different English accent than me. To be clear, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any trouble in understanding a different English accent, or in speaking English. I just feel like my brain needs to do an extra step of processing and converting before I respond. If you speak more than one language, it\u0026rsquo;s like the bump in the road when you\u0026rsquo;re comprehending in one language and responding in another. (Not exactly, but kind of.)\nIf this is something you face, it might be a good idea to communicate this openly beforehand.\n","date":"2020-10-18","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/beginners-guide-to-communication-in-foss/","summary":"Free and Open Source software is maintained by people working remotely from around the world.

The goal of technical documentation is to make complex technical information easy to understand. Hence, Plain English is an important aspect of technical writing. It makes your document more accessible, consistent, and readable.\nWhy Plain English? English is not the first language for many people. More people can understand Plain English compared to sophisticated English. Plain English is easier to translate. Common English words and phrases are more likely to have equally common counterparts in other languages. Plain English is easier to comprehend. Readers can focus on understanding the technical concept instead of decoding the sentence. Basics of Plain English Full Stops instead of Commas Use short sentences whenever possible. Avoid combining more than 2 sentences with a comma. Active Voice instead of Passive Voice. For example, prefer\n\u0026ldquo;X() reads a new file\u0026rdquo;\nover\n\u0026ldquo;A new file is read by X()\u0026rdquo;\nCut the Adjectives Most adjectives do not convey relevant information. For example,\n\u0026ldquo;This well-written function reads a new file\u0026rdquo;\ncan be shortened to\n\u0026ldquo;This function reads a new file\u0026rdquo;\nGet to the point quickly and stick to the point.\nInclusive Language and Biases Avoid using pronouns altogether. If you need to, then: use \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;folks\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;everyone\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;girls\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;guys\u0026rdquo;. See heyguys.cc. Avoid racist terms like \u0026ldquo;blacklist\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;slave\u0026rdquo;, etc. Avoid phrases like \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s as simple as\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;this is an easy step\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, etc. What is easy for one person, may not be easy for someone else[1]. Let\u0026rsquo;s not discourage learners by using these terms. Actively check for biases in your writing. For example, sample names may have gender or racial biases depending on the context. As humans, we may never be completely unbiased. It is still important to educate ourselves and keep trying. Avoid Jargon, use Common Words Technical documentation has a lot of technical jargon. Let\u0026rsquo;s not add more. One way to reduce jargon is to get feedback from a diverse range of readers.\nNote that slangs are also jargon.\nExtra Tips Planning It is good practice to plan a document before you start writing. Think about the following:\nIntended audience Scope of the document Broader context Structure Start with a rough structure. Try to split each concept into a distinct section. Clear structure and headings improve readability.\nStyle Guides Style guides are standards to help maintain consistency in documentation. Consider adopting a style guide for your technical writing projects, even personal blogs.\n[1] I have used \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; in this blog post. But, note that I\u0026rsquo;m using it in a comparative context.

But, over the past week, it has turned into something much bigger. As I learn more about data visualization, I realized there\u0026rsquo;s more I want to share.\nThis is not intended as a tutorial or a comprehensive guide. It is just me sharing some notes and thoughts and hoping you find it useful.\nWhat is Data Visualization? In general, it is the visual representation of some data.\nRight? Well\u0026hellip; not quite. It is a little more nuanced and fascinating.\nVisualization, not data visualization, just \u0026lsquo;visualization\u0026rsquo; is a broad term. This is the visual representation of some information [1]. It can be for the purpose of exploration, analysis, etc.\nVisualizations can be charts, maps, infographics, news application and data visualization.\nCharts (aka plots and graphs): data presented with symbols that have different shapes, colours, or sizes Maps: representation of a geographical area or data that corresponds to that area Infographics: multi-section visual representation of information intended to communicate one or more specific messages News Application: special kind of visualization that lets people relate the presented data to their own life; mostly interactive Data Visualization: display of data designed to enable analysis, exploration, and discovery The boundaries here are not strict. In fact, these blend into each other very beautifully.\nAnother way to categorize is into information visualization, scientific visualization, geographical visualization.[4]\nSciViz: 3d objects used to represent data; often depict flows, surfaces, volumes GeoViz: 2d or 3d objects can be used to represent data; map-based; uses spacial coordinates InfoViz: deals with abstract data like hierarchies, networks and multi-dimensional spaces Data Visualization, in this case, encompasses SciViz and GeoViz. Data Visualization along with Analytics forms Visual Analytics.\nWhy Visualize? Authors seem to agree that a primary reason to visualize data is to gain insight. They also agree that Data Visualization is supposed to augment and enhance human exploration and understanding, not replace it.\nAnother important reason is to convey the truth. \u0026lsquo;Truth\u0026rsquo; is subjective, and we all have biases that tend to push us away from the truth line, but still, aiming for truth is a worthy goal. A step in this direction is acknowledging our inherent biases and actively trying to correct for it. It is also essential to not manipulate the graphs for personal gains - explicitly or implicitly. When I say explicitly, I mean when the visualization is wrong and doesn\u0026rsquo;t present the actual information. When I say implicitly, I mean manipulating the visualizations such that a different message from the real truth is communicated, even if the data is accurate.\nOne example is this tweet that went viral (kind of) a few weeks back:\nThe y-axis starts at 5'0\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;, this exaggerates the difference in heights significantly. If we read the chart carefully, we can tell the difference between the smallest and largest height in the chart is just 5 inches (not a lot!). Hence, this plot is misleading.\nLastly, we visualize because human visual understanding far outweighs any other human senses. We can take in a lot of visual information at once. We can spot similarities, differences and correlations with ease. We can also make some information pop-out.\nHow Do I Learn Visualization? This is something I had to figure out before jumping in. There seem to be different aspects of Data Visualization that I need to learn. These can also be thought of as different ways to learn data visualization.\nFirst, we need to look at the different types of data and how they are represented. Data can be categorical, continuous, discrete, etc., and it can be represented as text, tables, images, etc. Once the data is understood, we can talk about the idioms (viz techniques) that can be used to visualize them.\nSecond, there are some best practices, ethics and rules for creating good visualizations. The y-axis manipulation example is just one not-so-good practice. We can talk about different idioms and explore the best practices for each. For example, the use of size, shape and colours to represent data - when to use what.\nThird, we need to learn to use some data visualization tools effectively. There are many tools available. The tool of choice depends on our use case. In this series, we will mainly be working with Python - Matplotlib and Bokeh.\nFinally, the more we learn, the more things there are to learn. For example, interactive plots can be explored in-depth, we can discuss the above three aspects individually for interactive plots too! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see where this series takes us!\nReferences I referred to the following books to write this blog post:\n[1] The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication by Alberto Cairo [2] Fundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus O.

It is likely quite outdated, and may not reflect my current thoughts and beliefs.\nOne of my resolutions for 2020 is to read regularly. Reading, especially reading books, helps me stay centred. I find it meditative and the hours count towards my \u0026ldquo;me time\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read some really good books so far this year, I want to share them here.\nBecoming by Michelle Obama This book made waves when it was released. It is definitely one of the best books I\u0026rsquo;ve read so far. Michelle Obama is an excellent storyteller. I\u0026rsquo;m sure everyone who reads this will relate to her experiences in some way. It was vulnerable and empowering. It was emotional and inspiring. It had surprises and humour. It was also a super easy read. I loved it, in case you couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell by now. Her childhood, her family, her friends, they have shaped her values. When her school career counsellor underestimates her, we are reminded of all the people who underestimate(d) us. When she doubts herself and asks if she\u0026rsquo;s good enough, we think of all the times we thought so too. When she says criticism hurts, it gives us permission to hurt too. She has always been a role model. Not just for me, but so many people around the world. With this book, we again realize why.\nMy Sister\u0026rsquo;s Keeper by Jodi Picoult This is the only novel I\u0026rsquo;ve read in 2020 so far and it was a really nice read. It was emotional and made me think deeply about the difficult choices in life. My heart felt very heavy reading this book. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to say, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spoil it for anyone. It was heartbreaking and yet, heartwarming.\nAtomic Habits by James Clear Many people call this a book for modern times. I agree. It is extremely easy to read, because the book is concise and to-the-point. Every sentence adds value and can stand independently. The main idea is that tiny micro-actions when performed regularly (i.e. habits) can make a huge impact. James Clear summarizes that to develop a habit, the task should be made easy, attractive, obvious and satisfying. Just like this book. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to read, the ideas presented are attractive, some are even obvious, and of course, we are satisfied with the content.\nDecoding the Technical Interview Process by Emma Bostian I got this book in a giveaway and read it the very same day. This is another book for modern times. Short, concise and uses plain English. The concepts are explained in a very friendly and digestible manner. I was familiar with most of the concepts. It was still a very nice brush-up. JavaScript was used to code the algorithms, something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen before, so that was interesting.\nCracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (You can tell I\u0026rsquo;m preparing for technical interviews. XD)\nThis book is a must-read for anyone looking for and applying for technical roles. Junior or Senior. It is a thorough guide that walks us through all stages of the interview, including the behavioural interview. It goes beyond just algorithms, it includes testing, systems design, databases, etc. There are also plenty of really good exercises to solve. Personally, this will be a handy reference for the foreseeable future.\nSteal Like An Artist by Austin Kleon Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been learning sketchnoting and I came across this book while looking for resources. It\u0026rsquo;s a tiny book, with a lot of amazing diagrams and pictures. The main idea is that new ideas come from old ones. They don\u0026rsquo;t spring out of nowhere. They come from past experiences. Steal like an artist means creative people steal ideas from others, they learn to present it in their own way which makes it\u0026hellip; original. Interesting!\nI also wrote a complete review of Moment of Lift by Melinda Gates and a summary of What Got You Here Won\u0026rsquo;t Get You There by Marshall Goldsmith. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, check those out too!\n","date":"2020-08-21","id":4,"permalink":"/blog/top-books-2020/","summary":"Warning\nThis post was written in 2020.

It is likely quite outdated, and may not reflect my current thoughts and beliefs.\nYou can buy it here.\nCW: book talks about discrimination and violence against women.\nThis is a very powerful book by Melinda Gates. The title, \u0026ldquo;How empowering women can change the world\u0026rdquo; communicates the goal of this book effectively. Definitely one of the best books I\u0026rsquo;ve read so far. :)\nI started reading it because I was curious. Bill and Melinda Gates are obviously popular public figures. I had read their annual letter and passively followed the news around their philanthropic work, but I was not prepared for how impactful this book would be.\nMelinda Gates shares her personal stories \u0026ndash; how she got interested in tech, her relationship with Bill Gates, her path to equal partnership, her experiences, her learnings and more. But most importantly, she shares stories of numerous people from around the globe from different walks of life. Mothers, daughters, field workers, farmers, students, everyone.\nShe talks about how lifting women up, lifts the entire community up. A fascinating idea was how all social issues are connected. Poverty, disease, discrimination, all are linked to each other. One feeds the others. No problems are isolated.\nMany social issues are broken down. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with family planning. This included providing women access to contraceptives. The author discusses the challenges women faced, how the foundation understood the hidden hurdles and how they are making progress. Issues including child marriage, girls education, domestic violence and harmful traditions are discussed in detail. We hear stories of strong and resilient women. Women like Kakenya who traded a part of her body to get an education, and came back to her community to serve.\nA very thought-provoking snippet from the book \u0026ndash;\nOvercoming the need to create outsiders is our greatest challenge as human beings. It is the key to ending deep inequality. We stigmatize and send to the margins people who trigger in us the feelings we want to avoid. This is why there are so many old and weak and sick and poor people on the margins of society. We tend to push out the people who have qualities we’re most afraid we will find in ourselves—and sometimes we falsely ascribe qualities we disown to certain groups, then push those groups out as a way of denying those traits in ourselves. This is what drives dominant groups to push different racial and religious groups to the margins.\nThis tries to explain why we discriminate against women, the LGBTQ+ community, and everyone living on the margins. Why rules are made by men for women, and how that is a sign of a backward society.\nThe author emphasizes that empowering the people on the margins relates to lifting up their image of themselves. Love and respect play a very important role.\nAnother interesting idea presented was how inexperienced contributors can cause more damage than do good. The wealthy sometimes select causes to support without adequate research. This moves the focus from what actually needs to be done to what is being funded.\nMany more topics are discussed in depth. One particularly sticks out to me. The author says when we hear stories of injustice, our first reaction is heartbreak, which is followed by anger. And the only way forward is acceptance. She says there is power in letting our hearts break. That is how we can feel pain without passing it on, as quoted in the book:\nThe loud voice of a man who has no inner life and is a stranger to his own grief is never a voice for justice; it’s a voice for self- interest, dominance, or vengeance. Strong male voices for freedom and dignity come from men like Gandhi, King, and Mandela who mastered their pain, gave up on vengeance, and preached forgiveness.\nIn the end, Melinda Gates shares:\n\u0026ldquo;The goal is not for everyone to be equal. The goal is for everyone to be connected. The goal is for everyone to belong. The goal is for everyone to be loved.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a way, I think her book embodies this vision. It connected people from around the globe, gave every story space on a stage where they belong, and carried the message of love throughout.\n","date":"2020-08-11","id":5,"permalink":"/blog/the-moment-of-lift-book-review/","summary":"Warning\nThis post was written in 2020.

This comes with a set of advantages and disadvantages, but we won\u0026rsquo;t go there today. The decision was taken after careful consideration and after listening to both sides of the debate. Let\u0026rsquo;s leave it at that.\nHere is my overall experience moving old posts to Medium. If you plan on doing this sometime, my learnings here might be helpful. Happy reading!\nBackdating posts When we want to move previous posts to Medium, we would also want to backdate them. Medium allows writers to \u0026ldquo;import\u0026rdquo; posts. If your original blog handled the date of publishing well, then importing posts should backdate them. You will notice a line at the end of your imported blog \u0026ldquo;Originally published at \u0026lt;your_blog\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;date_published.\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;\nIf the date_published is not shown, Medium is not able to parse the date you published the blog on. I added a time tag with the class attribute set to \u0026ldquo;published\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026lt;time datetime=\u0026quot;{{ page.date }}\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;published\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\u0026lt;/time\u0026gt;\nThis did the trick. :)\nImporting doesn\u0026rsquo;t work flawlessly Medium did not do a great job of importing all blog items. Please go through your posts properly before publishing.\nI noticed that list items, svg images, headings and code blocks were either not imported at all or were imported incorrectly. You can copy-paste all missing elements, but it is manual work.\nExtra stuff to note Accessibility Medium allows you to add alternate text to media elements (but limits it to 125 characters, why Medium?!)\nI doubt medium imports any alt text from the previous blog, so take a few minutes to add it. Accessibility Handbook by Katie Cunningham is a good resource that talks about the best practices for writing alt text for general images, tables and more.\nInteractive elements Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. So, of course, Bokeh\u0026rsquo;s blog post have a lot of cool interactive plots. How do we import these to Medium?\nWe settled on creating gifs. XD\nOuch, notifications! My post is ready to be published!\nI hit publish, and my phone buzzes with a notification from Medium (on my personal account) about the blog I just published. Hmm\u0026hellip; this is not cool. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spam all of Bokeh\u0026rsquo;s followers with old blog posts.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything on the internet, so I contacted their support. They kindly wrote back. :)\nSo, turns out, we need to \u0026ldquo;unlist\u0026rdquo; the post, then publish it, then make it public by \u0026ldquo;listing(?)\u0026rdquo; it again. Two extra steps, but well, something is better than nothing.\nFinal verdict Not a bad experience. Things could have gone smoother, but I do understand that it\u0026rsquo;s not really Medium\u0026rsquo;s fault. Personal blogging websites are all built differently and parsing everything accurately would be tricky.\nMedium\u0026rsquo;s support staff replied promptly and were super helpful. So, even though there were a lot of quirks, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too painful.\n","date":"2020-07-06","id":6,"permalink":"/blog/importing-blogs-to-medium/","summary":"Bokeh recently decided to move it\u0026rsquo;s blog, hosted at https://blog.bokeh.org/, to the popular publishing platform Medium.

People who tend to be very successful sometimes do not realize how their behaviour is coming across to other people. These super successful people have some bad habits. They need to realize that they are successful, not because of their bad habits, but in spite of it. Why We Resist Change (AKA The Success Delusion) Successful people have 4 primary beliefs, it’s why they’re successful, but it’s also why they resist change. It’s important we acknowledge and understand these.\nBeliefs:\nI have succeeded ~ I believe in my skills and talent I can succeed ~ I am confident that I can succeed I will succeed ~ I have the motivation to succeed I choose to succeed ~ Because it’s my choice and I’m not forced to do this, I’m committed. The Natural Law People will do something \u0026ndash; including changing their behaviour \u0026ndash; only if it can be demonstrated that doing so is in their own best interests as defined by their own values.\n20 Habits That Hold You Back From The Top Winning too much Adding too much value Passing judgement Making destructive comments Starting with (or using) “No”, “But” or “However” Telling the world how smart we are Speaking when angry Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work” Withholding information Failing to give proper recognition Claiming credit that we don\u0026rsquo;t deserve Making excuses Clinging to the past Playing favorites Refusing to express regret Not listening Failing to express gratitude Punishing the messenger Passing the buck An excessive need to be “me” How We Can Change For The Better 1. Get Feedback From everyone around you: people working above you, below you and alongside you (360 degree feedback). Also, family. :)\nAsk them to:\nLet go of the past Tell the truth Be supportive and helpful Pick something to improve themselves Types of feedback: Solicited, Unsolicited, Observational All are equally important and good.\nNote: Do not express your opinion on their feedback, just say “thank you”.\n2. Apologise Tell people that you’re sorry for your behaviour. Be sincere. It helps people let go of the past and help you improve. 3. Advertise Tell the world that you plan on improving. It’s incredibly hard to make people change their opinion of you if you work silently. Let them know you’re changing, they’ll slowly start noticing the changes. 4. Listen Think before you speak. Listen with respect. Ask yourself \u0026ndash; “Is it worth it?” before speaking. If you can do only one thing in this list, do this. Be a good listener.\n5. Thank (Self-explanatory)\n6. Follow Up Following up is important for being successful in this endeavour. Have a set of questions that you answer regularly. Questions can be \u0026ndash; “How many times did you NOT interrupt someone this week?” 7. Practice Feedforward Feedback is people analyzing your past behaviour and telling it to you. Feedforward is looking in the other direction \u0026ndash; future. Feedforward means people telling you what exactly you can do to improve. Folks love giving advice, make use of it. Rules For Changing You might NOT have a disease that behaviour change can cure. Pick the right thing to change (if 50%+ feedback giving people don’t think it’s a problem, don’t worry about it). Don’t delude yourself about what you \u0026ldquo;really must change\u0026rdquo; (what you think is the root cause, is oftentimes not the actual cause). Don’t hide from the truth you need to hear. There is no ideal behaviour (you can’t be an “ideal” listener, you can just be better). If you can measure it, you can achieve it (make sure to measure the right thing). Monetize the result (if you can see your bad habits literally costing you, you can make faster progress). Best time to change is now.

It is likely quite outdated, and may not reflect my current thoughts and beliefs.\nI like working with the Wikimedia community. I got to interact with some really amazing folks and the overall experience has been wonderful! Even though Season of Docs has officially come to an end, I intend to continue contributing and would welcome interested folks to join us.\nOutreachy-19 I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest here. The best part of working with The Wikimedia Foundation was helping the Outreachy applicants. I absolutely loved it! It was really nice to see so many people enthusiastic about open source software and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to have been a tiny part of their journey. :)\nI was mainly helping with the MediaWiki Action API project. We noticed that many applicants were facing similar issues, so we wrote a set of elaborate getting-started guidelines. I got to collaborate with Jerop Brenda on this, an Outreachy-18 alum and Outreachy-19 mentor, which was super fun.\nGoogle Code-In 2019 Goggle Code-In is another open source initiative that helps introduce students (aged 13-17) to open source software. I\u0026rsquo;ll be co-mentoring tasks related to the MediaWiki Action API and Documentation this year. =D\nOther amazing experiences Ideated on a mechanism to send Wikimedia-specific Zulip welcome messages to newcomers. A lot of new contributors reach out on Zulip and it\u0026rsquo;d be helpful to automate some welcome and getting-started messages.

It is likely quite outdated, and may not reflect my current thoughts and beliefs.\nMy mentor is awesome. Setting expectations early is important. A large portion of technical writing is research. I got the acceptance email! I was sooo excited and couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to get started!\nSpecial note: Sarah R. Rodlund was my GSoD mentor, and she is awesome. She is super knowledgeable, kind, supportive, patient and encouraging. Genuinely. The best part, she always spreads happy energy. I came out of every meeting feeling cheerful, energized and motivated to do more. Thank you Sarah! \u0026lt;3\nFirst meeting I was equal parts excited and nervous, but a few minutes into the meeting, I had calmed down.\nWe decided to start with doc development early and established an agreement to guide us through the next few months. It was so important that we set expectations early. We also discussed some personal goals that I believe we accomplished. :)\nTechnical documentation For the first half of the doc-development phase, we worked on improving the documentation for Wikimedia\u0026rsquo;s technical writers.\nThis was an interesting project. I got the opportunity to read different open source docs and style guides. I also enjoyed learning about different technical writing genres.\nIt takes time to write documentation and most of it is pure research; Actual writing is the easy bit. I had overestimated the work-per-week in my original time-line, especially considering I had a lot of college commitments. We realized this early and updated our schedules accordingly.\nOther documents we worked on, included writing some guidelines for prioritization of documentation tasks, text formatting templates and using graphics in technical docs.\nToolforge and Cloud VPS For the second half, we decided to work on improving the Toolforge and Cloud VPS documentation. I was new to this domain and it took me a few weeks to figure out the documentation layout and gain a basic understanding of Wikimedia Cloud Services. I liked it. We decided to start by working on the navigation and categories before moving on to content distribution. We created navigation sidebars for Toolforge and Cloud VPS. We also accessed the categories and namespaces of the pages. Finally, I worked on documenting some tips on developing tools with Toolforge.\nI shall continue working on this project after the Season of Docs period. :)\n","date":"2019-11-29","id":9,"permalink":"/blog/season-of-docs-community-bonding-and-doc-development/","summary":"Warning\nThis post was written in 2019.

We regret the shots we don’t take. There are opportunities out there! For women, for everyone, we just need to reach out. Some tips on writing good proposals. I was introduced to open source software and Outreachy in early December of 2018. For those unfamiliar with Outreachy, it is an open-source initiative that provides internships in FOSS for under-represented folks in tech. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, you should check it out. :)\nI was thrilled to be eligible and decided to apply. The projects were announced in January and boy were they intimidating! I went through each of them and shortlisted a few that I felt were: interesting, difficult and rewarding. Then, jumped right in.\nI chose a project, took some time to read about the technologies, understand the contribution process and set up the development environment. With a lot of courage, I made my first PR \u0026ndash; a stupid mistake. The mentors were kind and encouraging but I felt horrible. As a college student, I was finding it difficult to manage my time, I was going through a mental burn-out at the time and I had chosen something way too difficult. I gave up. I tried looking into some GSoC projects, (there were sooooooooooo many!), but I didn’t bother applying, there were people who had started much earlier and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel qualified enough.\nThinking of it now, I think I gave up too soon.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I discovered Season of Docs, it is an initiative to involve technical writers in open source. It seemed interesting. The application period was during my Summer break and I was familiar with the application process this time, so I decided to give it a shot. But this time, I\u0026rsquo;d take it easy.\nWe learn from our mistakes, I chose a project that I was confident in, but it also required me to step a little outside my comfort zone \u0026ndash; at The Wikimedia Foundation. I reached out to my mentors and started exploring. I read article and books about technical writing, listened to talks and podcasts, and also joined some community forums. It took me nearly a month to learn enough about technical writing, navigate MediaWiki effectively, understand the documentation structure and find the right resources.\nIn open-source initiatives like GSoD, GSoC and Outreachy, the applicant community is a major part of the learning process. Participants working on the same project can share their experiences and help each other. At Wikimedia, communications related to outreach programs take place on Zulip chat. Many interested GSoD applicants reached out, but not many seemed to continue. Looked like they were having trouble getting started, so we worked on creating a \u0026lsquo;New technical writer guide\u0026rsquo;. I had documented my exploration phase, so creating this guide was fun. After which, I also worked on a couple of other documentation tasks. I have to mention here that the Wikimedia community was super supportive at every step. Special thanks to Sarah R. Rodlund, Srishti Sethi, Nick Wilson and Andre Klapper. =D\nThe final, most important step is drafting the proposal. Here\u0026rsquo;s a link to my final GSoD proposal. Some tips on writing a good proposal:\nStart early. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress this enough. It takes time to write a good proposal. Refer to previous year proposals accepted by your organization and other organizations. Have a clear structure in mind before beginning. Map out the different sections and what they should include. Be mindful about your time-line. We tend to overestimate what we can accomplish in one week. Finalize a draft early (1-2 weeks before the deadline) to incorporate feedback from your mentors. The application process served as my gateway into the open-source world. I enjoyed working on the tasks and continued doing so after submitting my proposal.\n","date":"2019-11-29","id":10,"permalink":"/blog/season-of-docs-application/","summary":"Warning\nThis post was written in 2019.
