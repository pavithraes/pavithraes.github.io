[{"content":"Free and Open Source software is maintained by people working remotely from around the world. Hence, effective communication is important for any project to function smoothly.\nEspecially, asynchronous-written communication.\nI started contributing to FOSS over a year ago. Communication was one of the first things I had to learn. I\u0026rsquo;m still working on it, but I think I\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way. Here are some key points I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up.\nBefore we get to the details, I want to preface this post by saying that asking questions and sharing your thoughts is more important than following any guidelines. You can improve your communication as you go, but never hesitate to speak up because you think it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;well-phrased\u0026rdquo;. People are nice. People will correct you if you make mistakes. So, the first step is to get involved in the discussion, you can then focus on improving. :)\nPlatform matters There are various \u0026ldquo;spaces\u0026rdquo; where people talk — mailing lists, discussion forums, private chat, issue trackers, etc. Each space has it\u0026rsquo;s own guidelines. It\u0026rsquo;s useful to know these while posting messages.\nMailing lists - Formal, email-like wording is generally preferred. You can start with a greeting and end with salutation+signature. You are expected to add a relevant subject line. Some people prefer to have a word wrap, it improves readability.\nDiscussion forum - Generally, there is no need for a formal greeting, salutation and signature. It is more informal than an email. Discussion forums typically include IRC, Discourse, Discord, Slack, Zulip, Gitter, Hangouts, and Telegram. Make sure that you understand a little about the platform and the primary reason why the organization uses it. For example, at Bokeh, Slack is used for development discussions and Discourse for community support. Also, note that some platforms like IRC have additional steps like registering your nickname.\nPrivate message - You can generally be as informal as in a discussion forum. There are no strict guidelines here, just be nice.\nMind your language Always, always, always use inclusive language. I wrote more about this in a previous post. Assume positive intent - Most people are nice and want the best for the project. Sometimes, their words may come across as rude or hurtful. Start with a foundation of positive intent: no-one wants to hurt you. This will allow you to not take criticism personally, and avoid any unnecessary arguments. That said, some behaviour is unacceptable. If any comments violate the project\u0026rsquo;s CoC, please take necessary action. Read the room - Try to be mindful of the emotions in the room. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this in 2020 when the world is having a rough year. Having compassion in your words and checking up on people are small acts of kindness that can go a long way. Be open to suggestions - Everyone has some value to add to the discussion. Be mindful about giving people a chance to express their thoughts and try to understand their point of view. Asking questions effectively Research and be specific - Take a few minutes to Google your question and go through the project documentation before asking questions. Most of the time, you will find the answer without needing to ask someone. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find the answer after say 10-20 mins of searching yourself, go ahead and post the question. Make sure to mention where you searched and what you found. Sometimes, things get buried in the documentation. Asking questions can surface them and the documentation can be improved. Include all relevant information - If you are facing a software issue, include relevant information like your operating system, environment, software version, browser info, etc. along with a minimal+reproducible example. This helps the developers diagnose the issue accurately, and saves everyone some time. Be bold - No question is a dumb question. Really! For example, instead of \u0026ldquo;How do I get started with\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, try:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going through the getting started documentation and I\u0026rsquo;m stuck at this step. Here is my system information and a reproducible example. I\u0026rsquo;ve also included a screenshot of the issue at the end.\u0026rdquo;\nPlease be patient FOSS contributors and maintainers are volunteers. After posting a question, be patient for folks to answer. It might take them up to 2-3 days to get back to you. If there is a holiday in their country or if it\u0026rsquo;s a weekend, it might take even longer. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get a reply after ~3 working days, you can follow up politely.\nAccent is a speed breaker This is a fairly recent realization. I have some trouble interacting with people who have a different English accent than me. To be clear, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any trouble in understanding a different English accent, or in speaking English. I just feel like my brain needs to do an extra step of processing and converting before I respond. If you speak more than one language, it\u0026rsquo;s like the bump in the road when you\u0026rsquo;re comprehending in one language and responding in another. (Not exactly, but kind of.)\nIf this is something you face, it might be a good idea to communicate this openly beforehand.\n","date":"2020-10-18","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/beginners-guide-to-communication-in-foss/","summary":"Free and Open Source software is maintained by people working remotely from around the world.

The goal of technical documentation is to make complex technical information easy to understand. Hence, Plain English is an important aspect of technical writing. It makes your document more accessible, consistent, and readable.\nWhy Plain English? English is not the first language for many people. More people can understand Plain English compared to sophisticated English. Plain English is easier to translate. Common English words and phrases are more likely to have equally common counterparts in other languages. Plain English is easier to comprehend. Readers can focus on understanding the technical concept instead of decoding the sentence. Basics of Plain English Full Stops instead of Commas Use short sentences whenever possible. Avoid combining more than 2 sentences with a comma. Active Voice instead of Passive Voice. For example, prefer\n\u0026ldquo;X() reads a new file\u0026rdquo;\nover\n\u0026ldquo;A new file is read by X()\u0026rdquo;\nCut the Adjectives Most adjectives do not convey relevant information. For example,\n\u0026ldquo;This well-written function reads a new file\u0026rdquo;\ncan be shortened to\n\u0026ldquo;This function reads a new file\u0026rdquo;\nGet to the point quickly and stick to the point.\nInclusive Language and Biases Avoid using pronouns altogether. If you need to, then: use \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;folks\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;everyone\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;girls\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;guys\u0026rdquo;. See heyguys.cc. Avoid racist terms like \u0026ldquo;blacklist\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;slave\u0026rdquo;, etc. Avoid phrases like \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s as simple as\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;this is an easy step\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, etc. What is easy for one person, may not be easy for someone else[1]. Let\u0026rsquo;s not discourage learners by using these terms. Actively check for biases in your writing. For example, sample names may have gender or racial biases depending on the context. As humans, we may never be completely unbiased. It is still important to educate ourselves and keep trying. Avoid Jargon, use Common Words Technical documentation has a lot of technical jargon. Let\u0026rsquo;s not add more. One way to reduce jargon is to get feedback from a diverse range of readers.\nNote that slangs are also jargon.\nExtra Tips Planning It is good practice to plan a document before you start writing. Think about the following:\nIntended audience Scope of the document Broader context Structure Start with a rough structure. Try to split each concept into a distinct section. Clear structure and headings improve readability.\nStyle Guides Style guides are standards to help maintain consistency in documentation. Consider adopting a style guide for your technical writing projects, even personal blogs.\n[1] I have used \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; in this blog post. But, note that I\u0026rsquo;m using it in a comparative context. I say: Understanding Plain English is \u0026ldquo;easier than\u0026rdquo; understanding sophisticated English.\n","date":"2020-08-24","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/plain-english-for-everyone/","summary":"Plain English is clear and concise English.\nTechnical writing is different from creative writing.

This comes with a set of advantages and disadvantages, but we won\u0026rsquo;t go there today. The decision was taken after careful consideration and after listening to both sides of the debate. Let\u0026rsquo;s leave it at that.\nHere is my overall experience moving old posts to Medium. If you plan on doing this sometime, my learnings here might be helpful. Happy reading!\nBackdating posts When we want to move previous posts to Medium, we would also want to backdate them. Medium allows writers to \u0026ldquo;import\u0026rdquo; posts. If your original blog handled the date of publishing well, then importing posts should backdate them. You will notice a line at the end of your imported blog \u0026ldquo;Originally published at \u0026lt;your_blog\u0026gt; on \u0026lt;date_published.\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;\nIf the date_published is not shown, Medium is not able to parse the date you published the blog on. I added a time tag with the class attribute set to \u0026ldquo;published\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026lt;time datetime=\u0026quot;{{ page.date }}\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;published\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}\u0026lt;/time\u0026gt;\nThis did the trick. :)\nImporting doesn\u0026rsquo;t work flawlessly Medium did not do a great job of importing all blog items. Please go through your posts properly before publishing.\nI noticed that list items, svg images, headings and code blocks were either not imported at all or were imported incorrectly. You can copy-paste all missing elements, but it is manual work.\nExtra stuff to note Accessibility Medium allows you to add alternate text to media elements (but limits it to 125 characters, why Medium?!)\nI doubt medium imports any alt text from the previous blog, so take a few minutes to add it. Accessibility Handbook by Katie Cunningham is a good resource that talks about the best practices for writing alt text for general images, tables and more.\nInteractive elements Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. So, of course, Bokeh\u0026rsquo;s blog post have a lot of cool interactive plots. How do we import these to Medium?\nWe settled on creating gifs. XD\nOuch, notifications! My post is ready to be published!\nI hit publish, and my phone buzzes with a notification from Medium (on my personal account) about the blog I just published. Hmm\u0026hellip; this is not cool. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spam all of Bokeh\u0026rsquo;s followers with old blog posts.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything on the internet, so I contacted their support. They kindly wrote back. :)\nSo, turns out, we need to \u0026ldquo;unlist\u0026rdquo; the post, then publish it, then make it public by \u0026ldquo;listing(?)\u0026rdquo; it again. Two extra steps, but well, something is better than nothing.\nFinal verdict Not a bad experience. Things could have gone smoother, but I do understand that it\u0026rsquo;s not really Medium\u0026rsquo;s fault. Personal blogging websites are all built differently and parsing everything accurately would be tricky.\nMedium\u0026rsquo;s support staff replied promptly and were super helpful. So, even though there were a lot of quirks, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too painful.\n","date":"2020-07-06","id":2,"permalink":"/blog/importing-blogs-to-medium/","summary":"Bokeh recently decided to move it\u0026rsquo;s blog, hosted at https://blog.bokeh.org/, to the popular publishing platform Medium.
