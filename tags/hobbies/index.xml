It is likely quite outdated, and may not reflect my current thoughts and beliefs. One of my resolutions for 2020 is to read regularly. Reading, especially reading books, helps me stay centred. I find it meditative and the hours count towards my &amp;ldquo;me time&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read some really good books so far this year, I want to share them here.
Becoming by Michelle Obama # This book made waves when it was released.</description></item></channel></rss>
