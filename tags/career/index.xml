I&amp;rsquo;ve read some really good books so far this year, I want to share them here.
Becoming by Michelle Obama # This book made waves when it was released. It is definitely one of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far.</description></item><item><title>What Got You Here Won't Get You There - Book Summary</title><link>https://pavithraes.me/blog/what-got-you-here-wont-get-you-there-book-summary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 11:20:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pavithraes.me/blog/what-got-you-here-wont-get-you-there-book-summary/</guid><description>A book by Marshall Goldsmith, you can buy it here. :)
