Definitely one of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far.</description></item><item><title>What Got You Here Won't Get You There - Book Summary</title><link>https://pavithraes.me/blog/what-got-you-here-wont-get-you-there-book-summary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 11:20:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pavithraes.me/blog/what-got-you-here-wont-get-you-there-book-summary/</guid><description>A book by Marshall Goldsmith, you can buy it here. :)
The Trouble With Success # Oftentimes, our previous success prevents us from achieving more.
