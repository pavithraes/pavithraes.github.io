This involves answering user question, reviewing contributor code, and maintenance activities like fixing bugs and updating the documentation. I have a few systems that make my life as a DevRel professional in the open source PyData space easier, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some here.
Disclaimer: These are things my friends (you know who you are, thanks!) and colleagues have shared with me very generously, and Iâ€™m just forwarding them here so more people can benefit from them.</description></item><item><title>Importing Blogs to Medium</title><link>https://pavithraes.me/blog/importing-blogs-to-medium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 23:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pavithraes.me/blog/importing-blogs-to-medium/</guid><description>Bokeh recently decided to move it&amp;rsquo;s blog, hosted at https://blog.bokeh.org/, to the popular publishing platform Medium.
