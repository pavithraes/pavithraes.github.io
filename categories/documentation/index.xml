Technical writing is different from creative writing. The goal of technical documentation is to make complex technical information easy to understand. Hence, Plain English is an important aspect of technical writing. It makes your document more accessible, consistent, and readable.
Why Plain English? # English is not the first language for many people. More people can understand Plain English compared to sophisticated English.</description></item><item><title>Season of Docs - And... it's over</title><link>https://pavithraes.me/blog/season-of-docs-and...-its-over/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 20:55:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pavithraes.me/blog/season-of-docs-and...-its-over/</guid><description>ðŸ‘‰ This post was written in 2019.
