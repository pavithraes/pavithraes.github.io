## Scaling Data Science with Dask

<i>PyData Delhi Meetup - 21st May</i>

My first in-person presentation since the pandemic!

This is an introductory Dask tutorial for folks new to scalable computing. We cover the basics of parallel and distributed computing, talk about Dask + how Dask works, and check out the Dask DataFrame API.

Material: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pavithraes/dask-mini-tutorial)
