## Data of an Unusual Size: A practical guide to analysis and interactive visualization of massive datasets

### PyCon US - 19th April

A ~3 hour tutorial on the fundaments of big data computation, from distributed computing with Dask to interactive visualization+dashboards with hvPlot+Panel. Read the compete [tutorial abstract on the PyCon US website](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/64/).

I couldn't attend PyCon because of visa-related issues. My co-presenter, Dharhas Pothina, presented the tutorial at the conference.
