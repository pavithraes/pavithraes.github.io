Hi! My name is Pavithra Eswaramoorthy[^1]. :wave:

[^1]: [Name pronunciation](https://youtu.be/wCC8jMaKQLQ)

I'm a Developer Relations professional and an Open Source Sustainer, with over five years of experience working with OSS communities and a background in Computer Science and Engineering.

## Work & Open Source

In my current role at [Quansight](https://quansight.com/) and [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/), I work on developer experience initiatives in the PyData ecosystem. In addition to company-wide awareness and community-wide sustainability activities, I focus on two younger community OSS projects:

* [Nebari](https://nebari.dev/) - data science platform that builds on the JupyterHub project
* [conda-store](https://conda.store/) - user-friendly and collaboration-first environment management library that build on the conda ecosystem

I'm also a part of the core team at [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) - a Python library for interactive data visualization. I work on maintenance initiatives including fundraising, developer workflows, project management, and mentorship programs. In my previous DevRel role at [Coiled](https://www.coiled.io/), I worked extensively on [Dask](https://dask.org/) with a focus on user and contributor support, OSS project maintenance, community engagement, and dev-evangelism. I started my OSS journey with the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) as a [Google Season of Docs technical writer](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Pavithraes/Season_of_Docs_-_Project_report), and continued contributing as a volunteer to co-administrate several open source outreach programs.
